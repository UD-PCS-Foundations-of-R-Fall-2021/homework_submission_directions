## Fork your own version of the homework repository to your account

-   Enable "Issues" by going to `Settings` > `Options` > `Features` and select `Issues`

## Clone the repository to your local machine

-   Use either the terminal (for Mac) or Git bash (for PC) to navigate to the directory that you would like to clone your repository to.
-   Follow these [directions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to clone the repository to your machine.

## Do your work! Make commits!

-   Open the assignment file in RStudio on your local machine.
-   Complete your work in the assignment file.
-   Save your work occasionally.
-   Use the add-commit-push pattern to update your work.

## How to "turn in" your homework

-   Make sure you have committed all the files associated with your solution in your local Git repository.
-   Make sure you have pushed the current state of your local repo to GitHub.
-   Open your private GitHub repository in a web browser
-   On the web page just above the files, look for the text "latest commit" followed by ten numbers and letters (called the revision SHA) and a clipboard icon
-   Click on the clipboard icon to copy the revision SHA to your clipboard
-   Create an issue in your private repository. Click on `Issues`, then on `New Issue`. Name the issue "Mark assignment x of *firstname* *lastname*", where *x* is, e.g. 1 or 2.
-   In the description of the issue, tag me by including my username `@rharrington31`, and paste the revision SHA.
-   Click "Submit new issue". You're done! Congratulations!
